# Formless
Fromless is a 2D top-down puzzle game, and it constitutes my entry to the 2026 Global Game Jam. 

All assets, e.g. art, animations, sounds, etc. are by me. Feel free to use them and the code for whatever. 

Since there is no obfuscation or encryption of any kind on any files you are free to modify your save file or even the levels themselves. In fact, in the levels folder, custom01.txt is intended to be a jumping in point to make new levels. Have a look inside to see how to make levels, then put them in save.txt to be able to play them. You can make new levels (.txt) by putting them in levels/.
