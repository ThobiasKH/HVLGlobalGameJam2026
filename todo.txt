Mask puzzle platformer where masks change gameplay, e.g.: 

Mask of stone 
- Makes you heavy 
- Pressure plates will activate when stood on
- Ice no longer slides 

Mask of wind
- Slide until hitting walls 
- Can cross gaps 
- Cannot activate pressure plates 

Mask of fire
- Can light stuff 
- Can endure heat
- Water kills you 

and so on.. 

TODO: 
- Fix bug where changing mask on potentiall deadly square doesn't 
kill the player 
- Implement level stuff so die -> respawn and so on 
- Consolidate mask logic and stuff to player. I.e. check if 
block is deadly AFTER we move onto it, should fix afforementioened bug
- Implement more masks, and make sprites
